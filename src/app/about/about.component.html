    <h1>All about SpaceShipSeeker</h1>
    <p>
        Our web application SpaceShipSeeker gives users a unique way to learn more about spacecraft and space in general. Our homepage shows users some examples of different
        types of spacecraft and gives them a countdown to the soonest SpaceX launch. Our map page allows users to view the locations of NASA observatories and SpaceX satellites
        and launchpads on an interactive 3D map. The map includes a filtering feature so you can view exactly what you want. The locational data for the map is all supplied by NASA
        and SpaceX APIs. We also have a Picture of the Day page where users can view a unique space picture everyday, along with an explanation of the picture, also supplied by NASA's
        APIs.
